        Use this analysis tool if you are looking to trade options. What are options?
        In finance, an option is a contract that gives you the right to buy or sell
        an underlying asset
        (this could be a stock, currency, bond
        etc) at a certain price, known as the strike price, before or on a specific date,
        known as the expiry date.
        The Black and Scholes formula is one of the most famous in finance, and is used to determine
        a fair value of an option. Essentially, if the option is priced under the value calculated
        for the expiry date, you would buy it.
        The formula is focused on European call options, meaning you can only exercise your
        right to buy on a specific date.
      </p>
      <p class="is-medium">
        Here's an example.

        Consider you sign into an option contract at £2, with a strike price of £50 and
        an expiry date of 1 year from now. An option contract usually includes 100 shares
        of the underlying asset, which in this case we will
        call 'XMPL'. You pay £200 for the right to buy 100 shares in XMPL one year from
        now, at a price of £50 per share.  Now let's imagine one year from now,
        the price of one share in 'XMPL' is £60. You have the right
        to buy 100 of these shares at £50. So you buy them for a total of £5,000,
        and then sell them at the current rate of £60 per share, meaning you now
        have £6,000. Now after accounting for the £200 you spent
        on the option, you made a cool £800 in profit.
      </p>
      <p class="is-medium">
        Using the B+S formula, you could have predicted the value of the option
        a year from now. If the predicted value of the option a year from now was
        lower than the strike price, you wouldn't engage in the contract,
        or you wouldn't exercise this right, although you'd have lost £200.
